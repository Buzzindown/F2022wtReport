            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Dear reader, I hope that after viewing this you can come to 
                appreciate all that I have accomplished and experienced while working as a web developer at 
                Relevant Bits. In this article we will explore the goals that I had set for this work term, 
                and reflect upon them. I will also attempt to summarize all of the fun and exciting things that 
                I’ve been lucky enough to work on over the past four months. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                &lt;About-Relevant-Bits/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Relevant Bits is a small, tightly knit group of bright-minded individuals 
                seeking to provide top-notch solutions to a wide range of customers, from small 
                single page designs to entire end to end web applications for large companies, 
                Relevant bits does it all. The team is distributed around the globe with around 
                half of the team in North America and the rest are scattered around Europe. The 
                team has a few projects on the go at <a id="goals"></a>the moment but the most notable of them is Context. 
                Context will be Relevant Bits’ first in house application that they’re putting on the market. 
                It’s an app for the Shopify ecommerce platform which will allow store owners to create 
                dynamic customizable marketing content for their stores based on a list of predetermined rules. 
                This was what I spent my time working on during the summer and I can’t wait to see it go live 
                in the next couple of weeks as I continue my work at Relevant Bits.

            <h2>
                &lt;Goals/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Now that I’ve introduced Relevant Bits, let’s talk about some of the goals I had 
                set for the term. Having already worked eight months at Phenom prior to joining Relevant Bits, 
                I found it easier to set more appropriate goals now that I had a little bit of experience under 
                my belt. The c goals for this semester were more aimed towards soft skills rather than any 
                specific technologies or technical techniques. Having said that, if I had set any goals aimed 
                towards learning and experimenting with new technology, I would have knocked them out of the
                 park! I got to work with so much new stuff this term, it was incredible. I’ll get more into 
                 that in the next section though, here are my goals which I had set at the start of the work term. 
                to me.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Become better at conversing potential ideas to my seniors. 
                    I knew Relevant Bits was a fairly small company coming into the 
                    work term, so I felt like there was more potential to really make a big 
                    positive difference if I could come up with some good ideas and solutions, 
                    I just needed to make sure I was heard! Also part of this goal was generally 
                    trying to become more confident during meetings and standups, which would in 
                    turn help make me a better speaker. 
                    <br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Become more comfortable working with other people. I know this one seems a 
                    little vague but the pandemic definitely stole some of my social skills and I 
                    wasn’t as confident as I wanted to be regarding working alongside teammates. 
                    Along with the social aspect, reading other people’s code, pair-programming 
                    and other technically involved social events can be difficult. My goal here 
                    was to become more comfortable doing these things. 
                    <br />

                </li>
                <li>
                    Continued creative problem solving and thinking. This was a goal I 
                    had during my time at Phenom but I really think it’s a critical part 
                    of my toolbox, so I decided to extend my goal. Creative problem solving 
                    can be difficult, but over the last two years I’ve slowly built on this skill 
                    and it’s proven to be super useful time and time again. My goal here specifically 
                    was to produce good solutions while continuing to think outside of the box and 
                    explore many possible options and become better at evaluating and acting on the best choice.
                    <br />

                </li>
            </ul>           
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;These were only my larger and more general goals for the work term. 
                As the weeks went on, I found myself setting many smaller goals and checking in 
                and evaluating my progress throughout the work term. Oftentimes I would be tasked 
                with learning some new technology and would set myself a goal with some degree of 
                mastery in mind as well as a date. This helped me learn stuff more efficiently, 
                as I was able to create a pace of learning which I could use to guide myself. 
                Please see the reflections section <a id="first-week"></a>to see how I did with the goals mentioned above. 
            </p>
        </section>
        <p>
            &emsp;&emsp;I suppose this is the bit where I get to tell you about all of the awesome stuff 
            I got to do over the work term! This term was filled with a ridiculous amount of 
            learning and I got to try out so many new technologies. In this section I’ll talk 
            a little bit about the technologies I learned, the struggles I faced, and the contributions I made. 
        </p>
        <section> 
            <h2>
                &lt;The-First-Week/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;To begin, I’ll briefly wind us back to the very beginning 
                of the term so that I can tell a short story of how my first week at 
                Relevant Bits went. The first day started off the same as many other remote 
                internships probably do, by logging in to Slack, or whatever communication 
                app your company might use. I was greeted by a message from every single person 
                inviting me to the team. This was great, everyone was super friendly, the morning standup went 
                well and I was on my way to trying to get my local environment set up with 
                the project that I had been assigned to, Context. As I mentioned earlier, 
                Context is the company’s first application that they’re going to be putting 
                on the market and it’s designed as an application for the Shopify ecommerce 
                marketplace. This app would allow store owners to create dynamic customizable 
                marketing content for their stores based on a list of predetermined rules. 
                That sounds cool right, so I was very excited to get to work on it. Unfortunately, 
                I could not, for the life of me, get the local setup running on my desktop. Over 
                the course of the week we tried just about everything to get this thing going. We 
                tried different Node versions, different packages, different security settings, 
                WSL and a couple of other things that didn’t pan out. It was tough, and I was starting
                 to feel pretty defeated after the first three or four days. But I just kept trying one 
                 thing after the other because I wanted to make a point to my boss that I was committed 
                 and could keep my head up, even when nothing seemed to be going right. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;At some point my boss also got fed up with nothing working and decided 
                to invest a little bit of time and money into Github Codespaces. Codespaces are super cool, 
                they’re a browser based instance of VScode running off of a docker image with whatever 
                config you want. So it was super easy to set up a basic Linux based machine with all 
                the right versions of what we needed and boom, we were in business. I was finally able 
                to start playing with the project, but <a id="my-job"></a>I had a week's worth of catching up to do since 
                we spent so much time messing around with my local environment. So, I did what any good 
                intern would do and proceeded to stay up for 48 hours straight over the weekend and read 
                through every single piece of the code base. Just kidding, I didn’t do that. I did however 
                manage to learn a lot of stuff really quickly which helped me recover from the first week. 
                Oh also, Relevant Bits somehow also knew I had a soft spot for company swag. So they sent me this 
                nifty little care package pictured below.

            <h2>
                &lt;My-Job/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;I was amazed by all of the tech that Shopify offers with its 
                API and other developer tools. Alongside all of the neat Shopify stuff, 
                I got to learn Koa which is just a lightweight version of Express. 
                I was fortunate that everything was in ES6 TypeScript, since I had spent
                 my last eight months working with React and JavaScript, all of the code 
                 was fairly easy to read. In particular I had never really worked with any
                  backend code, so all of the server side tech was fascinating to me. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;The project I was assigned to was already partially developed 
                but had been put aside for more than a year and was just now being revived 
                in the hope that we could get it to the Shopify app store by the end of 
                the semester. My biggest contribution to the project and the company by 
                far was the development of the app’s analytics system. The app’s goal in 
                short was to allow store owners to create customized, targeted material 
                on their Shopify store based on visitor’s information and a set of  “rules” 
                that the store owner would create in the app. This is relatively useless if 
                you have no way of determining the effectiveness of your customized marketing 
                material and rules, so we needed a way to track and display this data in a 
                meaningful way to the user. After the first month, and lots of discussion, 
                the analytics dashboard and tracking became my project. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;My first challenge was trying to understand the code that 
                was already in place, the code that was there seemed somewhat complete 
                but it was still seriously broken and used some outdated tech. I took a 
                few days to read through it and tried to understand the flow of the code 
                that was already written. It gave me some ideas, but the main issue I 
                arrived at was how this was seemingly going to become slower and slower 
                as time went on and the database filled up. The flow at the time was 
                essentially that we could track events in the user’s storefront, store 
                them in the database and then query all of those analytics events for the 
                store whenever the user wanted to view analytics. Since we were using DynamoDB, 
                which utilizes NoSQL, there wasn’t any good way to structure and query a subset 
                of this data. As time would go on, the query would get larger and slower. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;After much thought and lots of time spent at the drawing board
                 with my senior developer, we came to a solution. In the frontend, 
                 we would allow users to query data for specific days, using a datepicker. 
                 This would limit the granularity of their analytics but it would allow us
                  to create a smart querying system. For any set of dates that the 
                  user queried, we would check if the database already contained an 
                  entry related to those dates. The only way this could work is if we used 
                  very specific timestamps, in our case they would cover 24 hour blocks. Please see the diagram
                  below as a visual representation of how these data structures would fit together. 
            </p>
            <picture class="rect-img-container">
                <img srcset="media/AnalyticsDiagTwoSmall.png 700w," src="media/AnalyticsDiagTwo.png" alt="Analytics diagram">
            </picture>
            <p>
                  &emsp;&emsp;If we didn’t see one, then we would create 
                  an entry in the database which acts as a summary of all of the analytics
                   events for that set of dates. So in the future, if the user queried this set of dates, 
                   they wouldn’t be querying the entire set of analytics events, they would just get 
                   back that small summary statistic almost immediately and the request would be much 
                   faster. This sped up queries that had already been requested at some point in the 
                   past and also limited cluttering in the database. For an idea of what this structure might 
                   look like please see the diagram below, which I had made up for our internal documentation. 
            </p>

            </picture>

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;My next issue was trying to get analytics events to fire consistently in 
                the frontend. Specifically the issue was that I couldn’t find a way to reliably fire 
                http requests to the backend to store the analytics event data before the page unloaded. 
                I basically needed a request that would fire off, and didn’t particularly care about 
                getting a response back, since the page was unloading anyways. After asking around 
                and reading lots, I was stumped, and a little frustrated but also very determined. 
                Until one day I stumbled across the “sendBeacon” function, which is actually purpose 
                built for sending analytics events before the page unloads. Now I was in business and 
                the frontend and backend were coming together nicely. Prior to this term I hadn’t worked 
                with any backend code, or really written anything end-to-end like this. I’m super thankful 
                to have gotten to do this because it gave me such a good understanding and appreciation for 
                all the moving parts that go into developing an application like this. We used Koa in the 
                backend and a bunch of other new technologies that I had never seen before and I can’t 
                put into words how much I have learned while working at Relevant Bits. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;My final challenge was to develop a full blown test suite. Which was also 
                something I hadn’t faced before. The plan was to use Jest for unit tests, as well 
                as frontend snapshot tests and then write an end-to-end test using Puppeteer with 
                headless Chromium. I realized quickly that I wanted to interact with the database 
                during testing rather than mocking everything for every test. Great, there’s an NPM 
                package for that. I tried it, but it wasn’t exactly what we needed. I asked my peers 
                if it would be reasonable <a id="reflections"></a>to fork it and maintain our own version of the package, since 
                most of what we needed was already there. After discussion, we concluded that it was an 
                okay idea but we should try and find something else first. So, I ended up writing a script 
                that would automate the creation and deletion of tables in our Dynalite (mock local database) 
                instance. This allowed each test to have its own table during automated testing. This 
                solution would scale with as many tests as we could possibly write. I was proud that I 
                had done something like this because it was way out of my wheelhouse, it was scaleable, 
                and it used technologies that I would’ve been anxious to use prior to this work term. 
                From here, I finished out the analytics test suite, got it merged and continued to work on 
                getting the app pulled together during the last three weeks of my work term.

                &lt;Reflections/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Now that you’ve read about my time at Relevant Bits, it’s time 
                to do a little reflecting regarding my goals. As I had mentioned earlier 
                these are just the broad goals that I had set at the start of the term and don’t 
                fully represent the extent I went to planning and achieving other smaller goals 
                over the course of the term. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;Regarding my first goal, which was about becoming better 
                at talking about new ideas and solutions with my seniors. I think I 
                achieved this goal. Initially I was quite nervous and shy despite everyone 
                being more than friendly enough to make me feel comfortable. I think that once I 
                became a little bit more established the pressure that I had been feeling before to 
                perform was lifted, and I was less stressed while talking during meetings. 
                This allowed me to have the confidence I needed to communicate my ideas fully. 
                Another thing that I recognized was that I became more and more comfortable speaking 
                while using very technical language to explain my ideas. Before this, I would often 
                find myself using plain english to try and describe technical items because I would 
                be in a bit of a panic and my brain couldn’t keep up. It felt awesome to convey my 
                ideas in a way that other people could easily understand. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;In regard to my second goal which was about becoming more 
                comfortable working with other people, particularly in a team setting. 
                I also feel like I have achieved this goal. The social part of my goal was 
                fairly easy to achieve, but that has little to do with me, and everything to do 
                with my kind and caring peers. It was easy to get along with just about everyone 
                and I didn’t feel nervous for very long at all. The part that was more difficult 
                was the technical aspect, trying to read other people’s code and understand their 
                ideas on the fly was challenging. It probably took me a good two to three weeks before 
                I was able to easily read my peers’ code. Part of this is that everyone seems to have 
                their own style, and it shows in the small areas of codes, like if they use ternary 
                operators or not, or how they write their for loops. I think these things just take 
                some time to learn and get comfortable with, but reading diverse styles of code has 
                definitely improved my ability to quickly read and understand code in general. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp; My final goal was in regards to continuing my use of creative 
                thinking and problem solving. This goal turned out to be especially important 
                this semester. I ended up working with a lot of new technologies this work term, 
                and ended up revamping a lot of old code that was in the system. Because of 
                these two factors, my options were sometimes fairly limited in how much I 
                could change or write. Having said that, this actually made me become more 
                creative as it put pressure on me to come up with clever solutions that worked 
                within the constraints of the situation. Overall, I've definitely seen myself 
                improve in this sense over the work term and would say that I have accomplished my goal. 
                <br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&emsp;All in all, I’m quite pleased with what I’ve achieved this semester 
                and hope to have equal or better success in achieving my goals during my following work terms.

                &lt;Summary/&gt;
            </h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;To conclude, I began the term in a bit of a rough way, 
                but managed to pull through and make some valuable contributions while 
                learning an incredible amount of new technology and skills. There’s 
                plenty more that I could have added in here, but I think this is already a 
                long enough read. I made lots of great memories and met some fantastic 
                people and can’t wait to see Context go to launch and even beyond that as 
                I continue my work part time at Relevant Bits during this coming academic 
                semester. Finally, I’d like to give a special shout out to Bálint Kléri 
                for being a great friend and an awesome mentor. I've learned a lot from 
                him and without a doubt I wouldn’t have had such a successful work term 
                without his constant confidence inspiring leadership and vast array of technical knowledge.
